## Welcome to the Western Washington University Mastcam Spectal Plotter

This application is a stand-alone Python GUI, used for querying Western Washington University's Mastcam Spectral Database. With this application, you can produce quality, meaningful plot from spectra taken across Curiosity's traverse.

#### Installation

Currently, the MSP has versions for MacOS and Windows. To install, simply download the corresponding folder from the repository and place it wherever you like. Inside the folder is a README.txt file with instructions. For a quick start, navigate to the MSP directory in command prompt and run the command:
```
./MSP
```
or, if on Windows, simply double click MSP.exe.

In addition, you must contact myself or Melissa Rice to obtain the file containing the spectral information. Contact mee at starrm@wwu.edu, or Melissa at melissa.rice@wwu.edu. When you get the file, simply drop it in the directory of the .exe and everything will run as planned.

#### Versions
MacOS version is currently compatable with MacOS 10.10.5 onward.
Windows version is currently compatable with Windows 10, but may work with older versions of Windows as well.

If the MSP is not compatable with your operating system, let me know!
